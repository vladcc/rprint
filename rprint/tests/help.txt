Usage: rprint [FILE] [OPTION...]
Prints a range of lines with optional context.

With no FILE, text is read from standard input. "context" is the number of
lines that'd print before and after the result of all other actions. If
the range is larger than the number of lines in the file, the output is
truncated at the first and/or last line of the file.

Options:
-s, --start-num <number>
start printing from line <number>, default is 1

-b, --back-num <number>
print <number> lines back

-f, --forward-num <number>
print <number> lines forward

-u, --until <number>
print until line <number>

-c, --context <number>
print <number> lines before and after

-S, --start-str <string>
print from the first line containing <string>, overrides -s

-B, --back-str <string>
print lines backwards until <string> is found

-F, --forward-str <string>
print lines forward until <string> is found

-N, --nested <string>
print a proper nested block ending in <string>
start of the block is the argument to either -S or -F
if both are present, -F overrides -S
for example -S "{" -F "}" will print
{
 	{
 	}

and -S "{" -N "}" will print

{
 	{
 	}
 }

-e, --end
print until the end of the file

-w, --width <number>
width of the line number field, default is 8

-q, --quiet
do not print line numbers

-l, --length
print the number of new line characters in FILE

-?, --help

-v, --version

Limits : up to 2147483647 lines with max line length of 1023 characters
including the new line character.
